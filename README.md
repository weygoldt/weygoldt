I'm a masters student of neurobiology and evolutionary ecology with a focus on **animal behavior**. Currently, I am mainly following an exploratory approach in the analysis of **electric communication signals** of weakly electric fish üêü‚ö°Ô∏è. Specifically, I try to [detect fast communication signals](https://github.com/weygoldt/chirpdetector-cnn) in the frequency domain using a convolutional neural network. In my previois project, I focused [synchronously 'singing' weakly electric fish](https://github.com/weygoldt/synchronous-modulations) recorded in their natural habitat in Colombia.

Other than that, I spend my spare time with scuba-diving, photography and learning GNU/Linux. Check out my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/weygoldt/dotfiles).
